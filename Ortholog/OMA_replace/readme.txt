Since OMA is slow and lots of memeries is needed, we can choose three other methods for tree. Of course, The origin OMA will be done for the papers.
1.Blast-method:
use four or several genomes to do OMA. then choose the orthologs as querry to do blast to all genomes we have. at last, select the data from blast output to do OMA.
2.Fungi-marker from JS:
use Jason's marker builded on fungis to get the orthologs.
3.Ousmane's scripts:
Just be as references.
